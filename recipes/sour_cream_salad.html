    <h2>Fresh potato salad</h2>
    <p>Easy to make recipe, with <strong>available</strong> ingredients.</p>
        This salad is <em>incredible</em>, creamy, and crunchy all at once. 
        <p>Itâ€™s like your favorite dip meets the <strong>perfect</strong> bite of a potato.</p> 
        I recommend extra sour cream for that perfect cold crunch against the rich filling
    </p>

    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>  2 1/2 lb yukon gold potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot of salted water, then bring to a boil over high heat.
            <p>Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are almost fork tender, about 15 minutes.</p>
            <p>Drain the potatoes in a colander and place a dry kitchen towel over top.</p> 
            <p>Let the potatoes steam until they are fork tender, about 20 minutes more.</p> 

        <p> </p></li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together sour cream, red wine vinegar, honey, Dijon, garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper until smooth and combined. </li>
        <li>Once the potatoes have cooled, cut them into 1-inch pieces. 
            <p>Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl.</p>
            <p>Add red onion, the sour cream dressing, and chives.</p>
            <p>Gently toss to combine until all the potato pieces are evenly coated in dressing.</p>
            <p>Garnish with more chives and chopped red onion, if desired.</p>
            Serve immediately or chill in the fridge until ready to eat</li>
    </ol>
